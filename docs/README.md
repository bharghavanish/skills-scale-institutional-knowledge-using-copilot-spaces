# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This README provides a quick overview of the processes that drive OctoAcme projects and serves as a central index for detailed guides and standards.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme follows a structured, customer-first approach to project management that balances flexibility with clear accountability. Projects begin with a defined **Project Charter** and **Roadmap** to align business goals and stakeholder expectations. Ownership of processes and outcomes is clearly assigned to promote transparency and drive progress through all project phases.

Workflows are built around iterative delivery, leveraging collaboration among key personas, including Project Managers, Product Owners, Developers, QA Engineers, and Stakeholders. Decision-making is driven by data, with regular checkpoints fostering feedback and ensuring alignment to customer value. Detailed tracking—via artifacts such as Backlogs, Risk Registers, and Retrospectives—enables continuous improvement and proactive risk management.

Communication strategies emphasize clarity, accessibility, and continuity. Formal touchpoints (stand-ups, reviews, retrospectives) are scheduled alongside ad hoc collaboration, underpinned by shared documentation and digital channels. Documentation serves as both onboarding material for new team members and a living record of decisions.

Quality assurance is integrated at every stage, with clearly delineated QA roles, automated and manual testing processes, and acceptance criteria for all deliverables. Continuous improvement is championed via retrospectives and data-driven metrics, ensuring lessons learned are reflected in evolving best practices.
